/**
 * Makes a Material ripple the default [LocalIndication] for everything in [content].
 *
 * The app declares no theme-level indication, so a bare `Modifier.clickable { }`
 * shows no ripple by default — each call site otherwise has to pass
 * `indication = ripple()` explicitly. Wrapping a screen root in this gives every
 * `clickable`/`selectable`/`toggleable` below it a ripple for free.
 *
 * Call sites keep full control: passing an explicit `indication` (including
 * `indication = null` for tap-to-dismiss surfaces that should not ripple) still
 * wins over this default.
